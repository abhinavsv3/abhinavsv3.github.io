title: "30 Days of Github Streaking"
---

This winter I started off with an interesting aim, trying to maximize my commit streak on github.
<br/>
First of all, it’s really fun to see your stats (the green graph on your profile), and once you have a streak going, you should avoid breaking it! C'mon who likes seeing gray idle zones in a green graph!

It all started when I was working on <a href="http://sushant-hiray.github.io/tshn/">TSHN</a> I noticed that I had bettered my previous best was of 17 days streak! It was a lack-luster streak that I wanted to improve but just couldn’t find enough motivation. 
<br/>And <bold>bang</bold> I broke my streak in just  <a href="https://github.com/sushant-hiray?tab=contributions&from=2013-12-13">3 days</a> :(
<br/>
So I decided to set up a task for myself.
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>The 30 day challenge</h3>
The task was simple: to keep the streak for atleast 30 days. <br/>
I started this streak off with a bang, contributing nearly <a href="https://github.com/sushant-hiray?tab=contributions&from=2013-12-15">20 commits</a> to my <a href="http://sushant-hiray.github.io/">website</a> and other various projects on the second day. Soon I wen past that with <a href="https://github.com/sushant-hiray?tab=contributions&from=2013-12-17">34 contributions</a>This actually happened to be the most contributions in a single day that I made throughout the current streak.
<br/>
<br/>
One week into the challenge it was getting though to keep on contributing.
I was nearly forgetting to commit or otherwise contribute, waiting until the last possible moment to submit my daily contribution. Ofcourse since GitHub runs on PST, which meant I could contribute anywhere from 12am — 1:30pm local time (IST) and have it count for the previous day. When I got home extra late a few nights, this trick had my back.
<br/>
<br/>
Three weeks in it was easier to remember to commit, it was becoming more of a habit. 
<br/>
<br/>
<i>Thirty days</i> was exciting! I had made it! And all I wanted to do was keep going! After a couple of weeks, it just became a way of life. Eat, sleep, commit was a part of routine and I no longer found it difficult to include in my day-to-day rituals. But it was hard to be 100% consistent, so there were definitely some close calls on busy days and some tricks did help me save from ruining my streak. <br/>

<h3>Looking Back</h3>
Looking back to the past 30 days, it has been quite fun to push myself and make sure I donot leave a dry mark. Also I did learn a couple of stuff:
<ul>
	<li>Try to work on multiple projects, in this way you have enough ways to contribute code </li>
	<li>Its not necessary to start your own project, helping someone with minor fixes is almost as good. After all that is what social coding is for </li>
	<li>I've noticed quite a few people commit a bulk of changes obly once, but this sorta beats the purpose of using version control. Try to break a big task into small sub tasks and commit them accordingly, this will help to revert back easily. Regardless to say, it does help increase your contribution stats!
</ul>	
All in all it has been a git streak winter! I'm not sure how much more I can possibly extend this streak considering we have the most dreadful 3rd year 2nd sem starting!
<br/><br/>
Happy Streaking!
