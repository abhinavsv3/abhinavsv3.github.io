title: "Paradigm Shift"
---
Most people come into your life temporarily simply to teach you something. They come and go. But some people stay. Some of them bring about a change we never thought would happen. Sometimes it will feel weird when you realize you spend so much time with someone till they become an integral part of yours and once they do become we tend to become careless. But that’s exactly how it’s supposed to be.

I've been getting too much into this 3rd year 2nd sem. Latest of it being missing birthday of someone special :( . And this one not being the first time, recently I've been topping up this business of forgetting dates. <br>Ofcourse you might as well argue that why wouldn't I get a decent reminder app. Well that's not the point you retard.

Its time I change my ways, give back the enough attention people deserve and would love to have.

Self realization and a paradigm shift in my thought process.

ps Sorry for not being there at times when you needed me. I'll try my best to change! :)
