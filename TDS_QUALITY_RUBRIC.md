## Quick Self-Assessment

Before submitting, ask:

| Question | If NO, fix it |
|----------|---------------|
| Would I bookmark this? | Add more unique value |
| Would I share this with a colleague? | Make it more actionable |
| Does the intro hook me in 30 seconds? | Rewrite the opening |
| Can I skim and still get value? | Add better headers/visuals |
| Is there something here I can't find elsewhere? | Add original data/experience |

## Applying This to Scaling Thoughts

### Current Blog Post Scores (Estimated)

| Post | Score | Gap |
|------|-------|-----|
| MHA vs GQA vs MLA | 10/20 | No original data, generic explainer |
| MoE Scaling | 10/20 | Summarizes papers, no unique angle |
| Pre-Norm vs Post-Norm | 12/20 | Better narrative, still no experiments |
| Flash Attention | 10/20 | Explains concept, Tri Dao does it better |
| Linear Attention | 10/20 | Overview without depth |
| GPU Utilization | 8/20 | Most generic, no evidence |
| Prefill vs Decode | 10/20 | Clear but standard knowledge |

### What Would Make Them TDS-Level

| Missing Element | How to Fix |
|-----------------|------------|
| Original data | Run benchmarks, even on laptop |
| Unique angle | "Here's what surprised me when I tried X" |
| Proof of claims | Add actual measurements |
| Personal voice | Share real experience from Amazon work |
| Strong hook | Lead with the insight, not the background |
