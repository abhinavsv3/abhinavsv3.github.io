title: "Using Jekyll"
---
Since last couple of weeks, we've been busy setting up a "community" website for WnCC. The main philosophy behind the website setup is that, anyone should be able to add content to the website, and not just the admin group, which has been the case always.

Being a group of enthusiastic developers, trying to automate the deployment process and version controlling the content were on the top of the priority list.

Having tried quite a few systems, we finally zeroed in on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

Hello, [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

Using Github Pages, we were able to get a site up and running in no time flat. Now, mind you, we’ve been making a steady sleuth of changes over the past couple of weeks to modularize everything, but I think we’ve got the structure nearly down to a T.

Considering Jekyll is backed by Github, I’m relying on the fact that they won’t remove support for it someday.But if they do, I’ve luckily got every change we’ve ever made to our website backed up with git! Another great reason to go the Github route, because every publish to the site is made through a commit and push to Github.
