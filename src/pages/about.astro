      <p>
        Hi, I'm <strong>Abhinav</strong>. I'm a Software Engineer at <strong>Amazon</strong>,
        currently working in the Special Projects group focused on Biology.
      </p>

      <p>
        I work on problems at the intersection of machine learning, distributed systems,
        and high-dimensional data. My recent work includes research on
        <a href="#">prompt optimization and translation across foundation models</a>,
        published at the Amazon Machine Learning Conference (2025).
      </p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        I hold a Master's degree from the <strong>University of Florida</strong>, where I was
        an Academic Achievement Award Scholar. My thesis focused on graph and matrix algorithms
        for visualizing high-dimensional data.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before that, I completed my undergraduate studies at <strong>SASTRA University</strong> in India,
        where I was a Dean's Merit Scholar and led the Computer Science cluster at the
        Daksh Techno-Management Festival.
      </p>

      <h2>Interests</h2>
      <p>
        I'm particularly interested in:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Machine learning and foundation models</li>
        <li>Graph algorithms and data visualization</li>
        <li>Distributed systems</li>
        <li>Computational biology</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>This Blog</h2>
      <p>
        Scaling Thoughts is where I write about technical ideas, engineering challenges,
        and things I'm learning. I believe in learning in public—writing helps clarify
        thinking and hopefully helps others along the way.
