        Hi, I'm <strong>Abhinav</strong>. Welcome to Scaling Thoughts.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm a software engineer passionate about building things and sharing what I learn along the way.
        This blog is where I write about technology, engineering, and ideas that interest me.
      </p>

      <h2>What I Do</h2>
      <p>
        I work on software systems and enjoy exploring new technologies.
        My interests span across distributed systems, machine learning, and developer tools.
      </p>

      <h2>This Blog</h2>
      <p>
        Scaling Thoughts is where I share my thinking process, technical deep-dives,
        and lessons learned. I believe in learning in public and hope something here
        might be useful to you.
