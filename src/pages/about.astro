      <p>
        I architect high-performance machine learning systems that define the frontier of model efficiency
        and large-scale inference. My work at Amazon's Special Projects incubator (Grand Challenge)
        focuses on the structural optimization of foundation models—bridging the gap between
        multi-billion parameter theoretical research and production-grade reliability.
      </p>

      <p>
        My recent innovations in prompt optimization and cross-model translation provide a framework
        for reducing computational overhead while increasing inference reliability. This research,
        which addresses critical bottlenecks in the scalability of generative AI, was peer-reviewed
        and presented at the Amazon Machine Learning Conference (2025).

      <h2>Global Research & Academic Pedigree</h2>
      <p>
        My technical philosophy—balancing mathematical rigor with systems-level scalability—was
        shaped through a series of international research appointments:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Scalable Algorithms (University of Florida)</strong> — My Master's research focused
          on pioneering graph and matrix algorithms for high-dimensional data, creating novel methods
          to extract structure from massive, complex datasets.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Relational Logic & Complexity (LARCA, Barcelona)</strong> — At the Laboratory for
          Relational Algorithmics, Complexity and Learning, I worked under Professor Ricard Gavaldà
          on the theoretical boundaries of relational algorithms.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Systems Innovation (Tokyo City University)</strong> — As an exchange researcher
          with Professor Takamichi Hirata, I explored the intersection of hardware constraints
          and algorithmic efficiency.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mathematical Modeling (IMSc, Chennai)</strong> — I gained early exposure to formal
          proofing and computational modeling at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, one of
          India's premier research centers.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Scaling Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        This blog documents my pursuit of the "optimal system"—where deep algorithmic theory meets
        the uncompromising demands of production environments. I write to dissect the engineering
        decisions behind modern ML, from low-level inference kernels to high-level architectural
        patterns for foundation models.
