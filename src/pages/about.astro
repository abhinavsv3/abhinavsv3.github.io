      <p>
        I build scalable machine learning systems at Amazon's Special Projects incubator (Grand Challenge),
        focusing on efficient foundation model inference and optimization.
      </p>

      <p>
        My research on prompt optimization and translation across foundation models—methods that reduce cost,
        improve reliability, and accelerate iteration—was presented at the Amazon Machine Learning Conference (2025).
      </p>

      <p>
        I care about making powerful models practical: efficient to run, reliable to operate, and production-ready.
      </p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        My interest in scalable computation and systems stems from early research across algorithms
        and high-dimensional data.
      </p>

      <p>
        My Master's research at the <strong>University of Florida</strong> focused on graph and matrix
        algorithms for high-dimensional data—work that continues to shape how I approach large systems:
        finding structure in complexity and optimizing for both correctness and efficiency.
      </p>

      <p>
        Earlier, I conducted research with <strong>Prof. Ricard Gavaldà</strong> at
        <strong>Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC), Barcelona</strong>, and was an exchange
        student at <strong>Tokyo City University</strong> under <strong>Prof. Takamichi Hirata</strong>,
        deepening my foundation in algorithms and systems thinking.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also interned at the <strong>Institute of Mathematical Sciences (IMSc), Chennai</strong>,
        gaining early exposure to rigorous mathematical research and computational modeling.
      </p>

      <h2>This Blog</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Scaling Thoughts</strong> covers machine learning systems, model inference, and the
        engineering decisions behind production machine learning. I write to clarify my own understanding
        and document what I learn—with a focus on systems, practical trade-offs, and insights that
        resonate with engineers and researchers alike.
