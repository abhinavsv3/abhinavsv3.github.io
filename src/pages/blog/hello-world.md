Welcome to Scaling Thoughts!

This is my new blog where I'll be sharing thoughts on technology, software engineering, and building things. I've been meaning to write more publicly for a while, and this is finally the place for it.

## Why "Scaling Thoughts"?

The name comes from the idea that writing helps scale your thinking. When you write something down:

1. **It forces clarity** - You can't write about something you don't understand
2. **It reaches more people** - Ideas can spread beyond 1:1 conversations
3. **It creates a record** - Future you can revisit past thinking

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- **Technical deep-dives** - Breaking down complex systems and concepts
- **Engineering practices** - How to build software that works
- **Lessons learned** - Things I wish I knew earlier
- **Interesting problems** - Challenges I encounter and how I approach them

## Let's Go

If any of this sounds interesting, stick around. You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/abhinavsv3) and [GitHub](https://github.com/abhinavsv3).

Thanks for reading!
