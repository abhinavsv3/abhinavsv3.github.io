| Peer Review | 2 (ICLR workshop, AMLC) | Moderate |
| Blog Posts | 6 educational explainers | Weak for EB1A |
| Online Presence | Scholar, ORCID, Semantic Scholar linked | Good |

## Priority Actions

### P0 — High Impact, Do Now

| # | Action | Why It Matters | Status |
|---|--------|----------------|--------|
| 1 | **Add impact evidence to About page** | $4M compute savings is strong EB1A evidence | Not started |
| 2 | **Get AMLC paper on arXiv/public** | Makes peer-reviewed work citable and discoverable | Check if allowed |
| 3 | **Complete Bar Raiser training** | "Judging others' work" criterion | In progress |
| 4 | **Document NVIDIA collaboration** | Shows industry recognition | Not started |

### P1 — Medium Impact, Do Soon

| # | Action | Why It Matters | Status |
|---|--------|----------------|--------|
| 5 | **Write 1 deep-dive blog with original data** | Differentiate from educational content | Not started |
| 6 | **File a patent** | Strong EB1A evidence | Check Amazon IP process |
| 7 | **Seek external peer review opportunities** | ICLR workshop is good, add more venues | Ongoing |
| 8 | **Add testimonials/recommendations section** | Letters from experts carry weight | Not started |

### P2 — Good to Have

| # | Action | Why It Matters | Status |
|---|--------|----------------|--------|
| 9 | **Get cited** | Submit paper summaries to ML newsletters | Not started |
| 10 | **Conference speaking** | External talks (not just Amazon internal) | Not started |

| 12 | **Media coverage** | Any press mentions of your work | Not started |

## Blog Content Strategy

### Current Problem
Blog posts are educational explainers — they demonstrate knowledge but not extraordinary ability.

### Recommended Changes

| Instead of... | Write... |
|---------------|----------|
| "How MoE works" | "I benchmarked MoE pruning strategies — here's what we found" |
| "Flash Attention explained" | "We reduced inference cost 40% using Flash Attention — here's how" |
| Generic explainer | War story with real numbers (anonymized if needed) |

### One High-Value Post Idea
**"How We Saved $4M in Compute at Amazon Scale"**
- Real impact, real numbers
- Shows extraordinary contribution
- Differentiates from every other ML blog
- Check what can be shared publicly
